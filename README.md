# Vectors-and-Tensors

* [Student’s Guide to Vectors and Tensors](https://www4.danfleisch.com/sgvt/) by Dan Fleisch

* The book aims to help you understand vectors and tensors so that you can use them to solve problems.
* Vectors are mathematical representations of quantities that have both magnitude and direction, such as velocity and force.
* Vectors behave in predictable ways when viewed from different reference frames.
* Vectors are a subset of a larger class of objects called “tensors,” which most students encounter much later in their academic careers, and which have been called “the facts of the Universe”¹.
* Tensors are far easier to understand if you first establish a stronger foundation in vectors, one that can help you cross the bridge between the “magnitude and direction” level and the “facts of the Universe” level¹.
* The book is divided into six chapters. The first three chapters deal with vectors, the fourth chapter discusses coordinate transformations, and the last two chapters discuss higher-order tensors and some of their applications¹.

'A Student's Guide to Vectors and Tensors' is a book written by Daniel Fleisch. It is aimed at undergraduate and beginning graduate students of physics and engineering. The book provides a thorough grounding in vectors and vector calculus before transitioning through contra and covariant components to tensors and their applications. Vectors and tensors are among the most powerful problem-solving tools available, with applications ranging from mechanics and electromagnetics to general relativity. You can find more information about the book on the publisher's website.
