# Vectors-and-Tensors

* [Student’s Guide to Vectors and Tensors](https://www4.danfleisch.com/sgvt/) by Dan Fleisch


- The book aims to help you understand vectors and tensors so that you can use them to solve problems.
- Vectors are mathematical representations of quantities that have both magnitude and direction, such as velocity and force.
- Vectors behave in predictable ways when viewed from different reference frames.
- Vectors are a subset of a larger class of objects called “tensors,” which most students encounter much later in their academic careers, and which have been called “the facts of the Universe”¹.
- Tensors are far easier to understand if you first establish a stronger foundation in vectors, one that can help you cross the bridge between the “magnitude and direction” level and the “facts of the Universe” level¹.
- The book is divided into six chapters. The first three chapters deal with vectors, the fourth chapter discusses coordinate transformations, and the last two chapters discuss higher-order tensors and some of their applications¹.
